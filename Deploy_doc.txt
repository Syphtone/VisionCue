1. Pipeline_2Fix(1).py

   This python file is the backend pipeline of the product
   MODEL_PATH = "your path to saved trained model (facelstm_WFH_v1.keras)"
   SCALER_PATH = "path to saved Standard scaler to ensure consistent data transformation during model training and deployment.(scaler.pkl)

   OPENFACE_PATH = "path to FeatureExtraction.exe"
      - you can find this file inside "openface\build\bin\Release\FeatureExtraction.exe" once you have downloaded using OpenFaceFINAL.ipynb to your system.
   
   OPENSMILE_PATH = "path to SMILExtract.exe"
      - you can find this inside "opensmile-3.0.2\bin\SMILExtract.exe". opensmile-3.0.2 is the zip file I have uploaded inside Video scripts

   OPENSMILE_CONFIG = "path to prosodyShs.conf"
      - you can find this inside "opensmile-3.0.2\config\prosody\prosodyShs.conf"

no need to change the rest of the functiom, 
a) convert webm to mp4 - the video recorded from the frontend will be in .webm format, this function converts it to .mp4
b) extract openface - extracts the facial features from .mp4 video using OPENFACE_PATH which is FeatureExtraction.exe
c) convert to .wav ffmpeg - opensmile can only extract features from audio files, so the video .mp4 needs to get converted into .wav
d) extract opensmile - extracts the prosody features from .wav audio file using OPENSMILE_PATH and OPENSMILE_CONFIG
e) align features - it merges the extracted opensmile and opensmile files into one merged file
f) preprocess features - the merged file then goes through this function data preprocessing takes place just like we did before training the model
g) predict from video - this function receives the video from api and the above function are executed and predicted using MODEL_PATH to get the result which is confidence score

2. Main_2.py

   This is the FastAPI python file
   nothing to change here
   
   RUN COMMAND
   uvicorn Main_2:app --reload

   Main_2 → your Python filename (without .py)
   app → the FastAPI instance inside that file
   --reload → auto-restarts when you make code changes (useful during development)

   @app.post("/predict") # Line 22
   async def predict(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
       logger.info(f"Received file: {file.filename}, content_type: {file.content_type}")

3. fixed-video-interview.html
 
   Front end user interface
   no changes required
   const BACKEND_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict"; # Line 226
